Marimba Path Utilities.

This module provides utility functions to work with the directory structure of a Marimba project, including locating
the project root directory and managing subdirectories.


Imports:
    - os: Provides access to operating system functionality.
    - pathlib: Provides classes for working with file paths.
    - typer: A library for building command line interfaces.
    - rich: A library for rich text formatting in the terminal.
    - marimba.core.utils.log: Provides logging functionality.
    - marimba.core.utils.rich: Provides utility functions for formatting output using Rich.

Functions:
    - find_project_dir: Locates the project root directory starting from a specified path.
    - find_project_dir_or_exit: Locates the project root directory or exits with an error if not found.
    - remove_all_subdirectories: Deletes all subdirectories within a specified directory, with optional dry-run and root
    directory removal features.
