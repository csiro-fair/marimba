## Overview

Marimba is a Python framework designed for the efficient processing of
[FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data/) scientific image
datasets. Developed collaboratively by [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/) and [MBARI](https://www.mbari.org/), Marimba 
provides core functionality for structuring, processing, and ensuring the FAIR compliance of scientific image data.

The framework features a [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) Command Line Interface (CLI) enhanced by 
[Rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/) for an improved user experience. Marimba offers a well-defined API (Application
Programming Interface) that enables seamless integration with external scripts and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

Marimba is particularly well-suited for researchers, data scientists, and engineers working in marine science and other 
fields that require large-scale and streamlined image dataset management. Typical use cases include automating the 
processing of imagery from underwater vehicles, integrating multi-instrument data for comprehensive analysis, and 
preparing datasets for publication in FAIR-compliant repositories.

## Design

Marimba defines three core concepts:

- **Project**: A Marimba Project is a standardised, high-level structure designed to manage the entire processing 
workflow for producing FAIR image datasets. It serves as the primary context for importing, processing, packaging and 
distributing these datasets, with all high-level operations managed by the core Marimba system.


- **Pipelines**: A Marimba Pipeline encapsulates the implementation of all processing stages for a single or 
multi-instrument system. Each Pipeline operates in isolation, containing all necessary logic to fully process image 
data, which may include multiple image or video sources, associated navigational data, and other ancillary 
information. The core Marimba system manages Pipeline execution, and developing a custom Pipeline is the only 
requirement for processing FAIR image datasets for new instruments or systems with Marimba.


- **Collections**: A Marimba Collection is a set of data that is imported into a Marimba project and can include a 
diverse aggregation of data from a single or multi-instrument system. Each Collection is isolated within the context of 
Marimba's core processing environment. During execution, Marimba Pipelines operate on each Collection in parallel, 
applying the specialised processing to the data contained within each Collection.

## Features

The Marimba framework offers a number of advanced features designed for the specific needs of scientific image 
processing:

- **Project Structuring and Management:**
  - Marimba enables a systematic approach to structuring and managing scientific image data projects throughout the 
  entire processing workflow
  - Core features of Marimba manage the parallelised execution of isolated Pipelines on sandboxed Collections, enabling 
  full automation of the processing workflow
  - Marimba supports the use of hard links during processing to prevent data duplication and optimise storage efficiency
  - Marimba provides a unified interface for importing, processing, packaging, and distributing datasets, ensuring 
  consistency and efficiency across all stages


- **File and Metadata Management:**
  - Custom Marimba Pipelines support the implementation of specific naming conventions to automatically rename image 
  files 
  - Marimba supports user prompting to manually input Pipeline and Collection-level metadata 
  - Metadata configuration dictionaries can be optionally passed via the CLI to automate manual input stages
  - Marimba provides extensive capabilities for managing image metadata, including:
    - Ensuring compliance with the [iFDO](https://marine-imaging.com/fair/ifdos/iFDO-overview/) (image FAIR Digital 
    Object) standard to ensure interoperability and reusability
    - Integrating image datasets with corresponding navigation and sensor data, when available
    - Embedding metadata directly into image EXIF tags for greater accessibility


- **Standard Image and Video Library:**
  - Marimba provides a comprehensive standard library of image and video processing modules that can:
    - Convert, compress and resize imagery using [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
    - Transcode, segment and extract frames from videos using [Ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (to be integrated)
    - Automatically generate thumbnails for images and videos and create composite overview images for rapid assessment 
    of image datasets
    - Detect duplicate, blurry, or improperly exposed images using 
    [CleanVision](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanvision) (to be integrated)


- **Dataset Packaging and Distribution:**
  - Marimba offers a standardised approach for packaging processed FAIR image datasets, including:
    - Collating all processing logs to archive the entire dataset provenance, ensuring transparency and traceability
    - Generating file manifests to facilitate dataset validation
    - Dynamically generating summaries of image and video dataset statistics
  - Marimba also provides mechanisms for distributing packaged FAIR image datasets including:
    - Uploading FAIR image datasets to S3 buckets

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

Marimba can be installed using the Python pip package manager. Ensure that Python version 3.12 or greater is installed 
in your environment before proceeding.

To install Marimba, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install marimba
```

This will download and install the latest version of Marimba along with its required dependencies. After installation, 
you can verify the installation by running Marimba and displaying the default help menu:

```bash
marimba
```

![](docs/img/marimba-help.png "marimba-help")

### System Dependencies

Marimba requires two system-level dependencies for its operation:

- **ExifTool**: Required for EXIF metadata reading and writing
- **FFmpeg**: Required for video processing functionality

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl ffmpeg
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install exiftool ffmpeg
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**
```bash
# RHEL/CentOS (with EPEL repository enabled)
sudo yum install perl-Image-ExifTool ffmpeg

# Fedora
sudo dnf install perl-Image-ExifTool ffmpeg
```

**Windows:**
- ExifTool: Download from [https://exiftool.org/](https://exiftool.org/) and add to PATH
- FFmpeg: Download from [https://ffmpeg.org/](https://ffmpeg.org/) and add to PATH

For other platforms or installation methods, please refer to the official documentation for [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

To set up a Marimba development environment, please refer to the [Environment Setup Guide](docs/environment.md), which 
provides detailed instructions and guidelines for configuring your development environment.

## Getting Started

Marimba offers a streamlined CLI that encompasses the entire post-acquisition data processing workflow. Below is a 
minimal demonstration of the key CLI commands required to progress through all the Marimba processing stages.

1. **Create a new Marimba Project:**

   ```bash
   marimba new project MY-PROJECT
   cd MY-PROJECT
   ```

2. **Create a new Marimba Pipeline:**

   ```bash
   marimba new pipeline MY-INSTRUMENT https://path.to/my-instrument-pipeline.git
   ```

3. **Import new Marimba Collections:**

   ```bash
   marimba import COLLECTION-ONE '/path/to/collection/one/'
   marimba import COLLECTION-TWO '/path/to/collection/two/'
   ```

4. **Process the imported Collections with the installed Pipelines:**

   ```bash
   marimba process
   ```

5. **Package the FAIR image dataset:**

   ```bash
   marimba package MY-FAIR-DATASET --version 1.0 --contact-name "Keiko Abe" --contact-email "keiko.abe@email.com"
   ```

For additional details and advanced usage, please refer to the [Overview and CLI Usage Guide](docs/overview.md).

*Note: [Keiko Abe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiko_Abe) is a renowned Japanese marimba player and composer, widely 
recognised for her role in establishing the marimba as a respected concert instrument.*

## Acknowledgments

Marimba was developed as a collaborative effort between CSIRO and MBARI, two leading institutions in marine science 
and technology. The conceptual foundation of Marimba was formulated at CSIRO in late 2022. Substantial elements of 
its initial design and implementation were developed during the CSIRO Image Data Collection and Delivery Hackathon 
in early 2023, with further collaborative advancements between CSIRO and MBARI in late 2023. Marimba was 
open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/csiro-fair/marimba) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/marimba) in 
mid-2024 and officially launched at the [Marine Imaging Workshop 2024](https://miw2024.org/).
